Welcome to the counting game for kids! This game is designed to help children learn counting while having fun. The game is designed for children from 3 to 6 years old.

## How to play

The game is very simple. The child must to addition two numbers and then write the result in the box. If the result is correct, the child will receive a clap and the game will continue. If the result is incorrect, the child needs to try again.

If an addition is too difficult, the child can ask new numbers by clicking on the button "New Game".

The game saves the best score of the child, and displays it in a box.
